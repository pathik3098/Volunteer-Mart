<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
More than 17% of Canada population are senior citizens and around 22% of people are the people with special needs. It is very difficult for them to meet their daily requirements and groceries are the major part. The conventional way of getting the groceries is that we need to go through all the sections in the malls and grocery stores to get the required stuff. This can be difficult for the senior citizens and the people with special needs. This is our responsibility to help them. There are people who would love to volunteer to this cause, but they need a reliable platform for this where they can get the details or the requests list which they can accept and deliver to. This is where our project, Volunteer mart comes into play. To provide a platform for requesting and delivering service where the people in need can order from and volunteers can accept the request and get the groceries from the store and deliver.

<h2>OBJECTIVES</h2>
Objective of our project is to ease the shopping experience for the people with special need and the senior citizens. This application will provide them a platform to order the groceries and other essential items from the comfort of their home, which otherwise would have required them to go to the shopping malls or complexes and go through all the sections to get those items. This application will also provide a platform for the people who would like to volunteer their services and in return earn points or money.
