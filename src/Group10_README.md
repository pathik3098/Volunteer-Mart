## Design Characters

Color Palette & Typography
As the application users are grocery shoppers, and while the application serves widely all the types of groceries more especially the Vegetables and Fruits are prominently focused. 
So we decided on the light green for the header and footer that resembles the freshness feel the users will be experiencing browsing through the items which gives a positive notion on the users overall experience in ordering and using the application. For the body it is white background with black text predominantly throughout the application. The other reason for this is also that white background and black text are the easiest to read because it provides the most contrast. 

Typography is one area that can steer the users away if not chosen carefully. It is quite obvious in the web world that fonts that belongs to the Sans-Serif family are the ones that more easily readable for the users to follow along content present in the website. So we decided to go with the Sans-Serif font family and in that we have chosen Verdana as our primary font throughout the application. It is also advised as a good practice to have fallback fonts as a safety mechanism in case a few web browsers of the the users were not to support the primary font we have chosen. So we have two other fonts Helvetica and Arial as our secondary fonts for the alternatives to Verdana. The size of the font for the Body will be Size 11, Heading(Product Titles) and Prices(Product) - Size 14, Navigation Bar Elements - Size 12.
